= Programming Language Notes

Personal collection of notes on programming language.

[quote, Linus Torvalds]

Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

I try to keep all notes short, simple, and concise, with clean code examples
(as much as possible) and explanations.  All notes should also be practical.
They are not meant to replace a carefully written guide or reference.

Should you discover any mistakes, please please please
https://github.com/cmpitg/programming-language-notes/issues[drop me an issue].
Your help is much appreciated.
