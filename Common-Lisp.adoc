* Quicklisp as package manager

== Tips and tricks

=== Getting current working directory

* Avoid +*default-pathname-defaults*+, it's implementation-dependent.
* (SBCL) SBCL: +(sb-posix:getcwd)+.

=== Changing current working directory/+cd+

[source,lisp,linenums]
----
;; Only in SBCL
(sb-posix:cwd "/tmp")

;; Require cl-cwd
(cl-cwd:cwd "/tmp")

;; Require cl-cwd, when you'd like to change it temporarily
(cl-cwd:with-cwd "/tmp/"
  (format t "~A" (directory (make-pathname :directory '(:relative ".")
                                           :name :wild
                                           :type :wild))))

=== Getting current file

+*load-truename*+ or +*load-pathname*+, returning truename and pathname,
respectively.  In modern system and practice, two kinds of pathnames could be
used interchangably.
